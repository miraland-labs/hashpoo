# Hashpoo: Hashing, once started, cannot be stopped at all. (Experimental)

## Hashpoo - for real hashpower only, specifically tailored for PoW believers and/or hashpower paranoids. It's a public oriented, simple and easy to join pool dedicated to ORE mining. It features pure PoW, no staking, no boosting, absolutely compelled by the real and physical hashpower of the entire community. Have fun.

**The goal of this project is to bring more consumer miners on board through easy and simple ORE mining operations, in line with the ORE design principle: anyone can mine.**

## Key Differentiators of Hashpoo

**No sign up fee, no sign up action.**

**Hashpoo does NOT cap or limit your hashpower in any way.**

**No delegating, no staking, no boosting, pure PoW, only hashpower.**

**Start mining when you connect. Stop mining when you disconnect.**

**Claim anytime at your own discretion (with reward balance >= 0.005 ORE).**

**Suitable for both casual and professional miners.**
